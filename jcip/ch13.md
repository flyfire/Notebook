/**
 * {@code Lock} implementations provide more extensive locking
 * operations than can be obtained using {@code synchronized} methods
 * and statements.  They allow more flexible structuring, may have
 * quite different properties, and may support multiple associated
 * {@link Condition} objects.
 *
 * <p>A lock is a tool for controlling access to a shared resource by
 * multiple threads. Commonly, a lock provides exclusive access to a
 * shared resource: only one thread at a time can acquire the lock and
 * all access to the shared resource requires that the lock be
 * acquired first. However, some locks may allow concurrent access to
 * a shared resource, such as the read lock of a {@link ReadWriteLock}.
 *
 * <p>The use of {@code synchronized} methods or statements provides
 * access to the implicit monitor lock associated with every object, but
 * forces all lock acquisition and release to occur in a block-structured way:
 * when multiple locks are acquired they must be released in the opposite
 * order, and all locks must be released in the same lexical scope in which
 * they were acquired.
 *
 * <p>While the scoping mechanism for {@code synchronized} methods
 * and statements makes it much easier to program with monitor locks,
 * and helps avoid many common programming errors involving locks,
 * there are occasions where you need to work with locks in a more
 * flexible way. For example, some algorithms for traversing
 * concurrently accessed data structures require the use of
 * &quot;hand-over-hand&quot; or &quot;chain locking&quot;: you
 * acquire the lock of node A, then node B, then release A and acquire
 * C, then release B and acquire D and so on.  Implementations of the
 * {@code Lock} interface enable the use of such techniques by
 * allowing a lock to be acquired and released in different scopes,
 * and allowing multiple locks to be acquired and released in any
 * order.
 *
 * <p>With this increased flexibility comes additional
 * responsibility. The absence of block-structured locking removes the
 * automatic release of locks that occurs with {@code synchronized}
 * methods and statements. In most cases, the following idiom
 * should be used:
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * Lock l = ...;
 * l.lock();
 * try {
 *   // access the resource protected by this lock
 * } finally {
 *   l.unlock();
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * When locking and unlocking occur in different scopes, care must be
 * taken to ensure that all code that is executed while the lock is
 * held is protected by try-finally or try-catch to ensure that the
 * lock is released when necessary.
 *
 * <p>{@code Lock} implementations provide additional functionality
 * over the use of {@code synchronized} methods and statements by
 * providing a non-blocking attempt to acquire a lock ({@link
 * #tryLock()}), an attempt to acquire the lock that can be
 * interrupted ({@link #lockInterruptibly}, and an attempt to acquire
 * the lock that can timeout ({@link #tryLock(long, TimeUnit)}).
 *
 * <p>A {@code Lock} class can also provide behavior and semantics
 * that is quite different from that of the implicit monitor lock,
 * such as guaranteed ordering, non-reentrant usage, or deadlock
 * detection. If an implementation provides such specialized semantics
 * then the implementation must document those semantics.
 *
 * <p>Note that {@code Lock} instances are just normal objects and can
 * themselves be used as the target in a {@code synchronized} statement.
 * Acquiring the
 * monitor lock of a {@code Lock} instance has no specified relationship
 * with invoking any of the {@link #lock} methods of that instance.
 * It is recommended that to avoid confusion you never use {@code Lock}
 * instances in this way, except within their own implementation.
 *
 * <p>Except where noted, passing a {@code null} value for any
 * parameter will result in a {@link NullPointerException} being
 * thrown.
 *
 * <h3>Memory Synchronization</h3>
 *
 * <p>All {@code Lock} implementations <em>must</em> enforce the same
 * memory synchronization semantics as provided by the built-in monitor
 * lock, as described in
 * <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.4">
 * Chapter 17 of
 * <cite>The Java&trade; Language Specification</cite></a>:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A successful {@code lock} operation has the same memory
 * synchronization effects as a successful <em>Lock</em> action.
 * <li>A successful {@code unlock} operation has the same
 * memory synchronization effects as a successful <em>Unlock</em> action.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Unsuccessful locking and unlocking operations, and reentrant
 * locking/unlocking operations, do not require any memory
 * synchronization effects.
 *
 * <h3>Implementation Considerations</h3>
 *
 * <p>The three forms of lock acquisition (interruptible,
 * non-interruptible, and timed) may differ in their performance
 * characteristics, ordering guarantees, or other implementation
 * qualities.  Further, the ability to interrupt the <em>ongoing</em>
 * acquisition of a lock may not be available in a given {@code Lock}
 * class.  Consequently, an implementation is not required to define
 * exactly the same guarantees or semantics for all three forms of
 * lock acquisition, nor is it required to support interruption of an
 * ongoing lock acquisition.  An implementation is required to clearly
 * document the semantics and guarantees provided by each of the
 * locking methods. It must also obey the interruption semantics as
 * defined in this interface, to the extent that interruption of lock
 * acquisition is supported: which is either totally, or only on
 * method entry.
 *
 * <p>As interruption generally implies cancellation, and checks for
 * interruption are often infrequent, an implementation can favor responding
 * to an interrupt over normal method return. This is true even if it can be
 * shown that the interrupt occurred after another action may have unblocked
 * the thread. An implementation should document this behavior.

与内置加锁机制不同的是，Lock提供了一种无条件的、可轮询的、定时的以及可中断的锁获取操作，所有加锁和解锁的方式都是显式的。在Lock的实现中必须提供与内置锁相同的内存可见性语义，但在加锁语义、调度算法、顺序保证以及性能特性等方面可以有所不同。

在大多数情况下，内置锁都能很好地工作，但在功能上存在一些局限性，例如，无法中断一个正在等待获取锁的线程，或者无法在请求获取一个锁时无限地等待下去。内置锁必须在获取该锁的代码块中释放，这就简化了编码工作，并且与异常处理操作实现了很好的交互，但却无法实现非阻塞结构的加锁规则。

```java
Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
...
lock.lock();
try {
    // 更新对象状态
    // 捕获异常，并在必要时恢复不变性条件
} finally {
    lock.unlock();
}
```

必须在finally块中释放锁，否则，如果在被保护的代码中抛出了异常，那么这个锁永远都无法释放。

可定时的与可轮询的锁获取模式是由``tryLock``方法实现的，与无条件的锁获取模式相比，它具有更完善的错误恢复机制。在内置锁中，死锁是一个严重的问题，恢复程序的唯一方法是重新启动程序，而防止死锁的唯一方法就是在构造程序时避免出现不一致的锁顺序。可定时的与可轮询的锁提供了另一种选择：避免死锁的发生。

在实现具有时间限制的操作时，定时锁同样非常有用。当在带有时间限制的操作中调用了一个阻塞方法时，它能根据剩余时间来提供一个时限。如果操作不能在指定时间内给出结果，那么就会使程序提前结束。当使用内置锁时，在开始请求锁后，这个操作将无法取消，因此内置锁很难实现带有时间限制的操作。

正如定时的锁获取操作能在带有时间限制的操作中使用独占锁，可中断的锁获取操作同样能在可取消的操作中使用加锁。``lockInterruptibly``方法能够在获得锁的同时保持对中断的响应。

在ReentrantLock的构造函数中提供了两种公平性选择：创建一个非公平的锁（默认）或者一个公平的锁。在公平的锁上，线程将按照它们发出请求的顺序来获得锁，但在非公平的锁上，则允许插队：当一个线程请求非公平的锁时，如果在发出请求的同时该锁的状态变为可用，那么这个线程将跳过队列中所欲的等待线程并获得这个锁。非公平的ReentrantLock并不提倡插队行为，但无法防止某个线程在合适的时候进行插队。在公平的锁中，如果有另一个线程持有这个锁或者有其他线程在队列中等待这个锁，那么新发出请求的线程将被放入队列中。在非公平的锁中，只有当锁被某个线程持有时，新发出请求的线程才会被放入队列中。

当持有锁的时间相对较长，或者请求锁的平均时间间隔较长，那么应该使用公平锁。在这种情况下，插队带来的吞吐量提升（当锁处于可用状态时，线程却还处于被唤醒的过程中）则可能不会出现。

与默认的ReentrantLock一样，内置锁并不会提供确定的公平性保证，但在大多数情况下，在锁实现上实现统计上的公平性保证已经足够了。Java语言规范并没有要求JVM以公平的方式实现内置锁，而在各种JVM中也没有这样做。

ReentrantLock在加锁和内存上提供的语义域内置锁相同，此外它还提供了一些其他功能，包括定时的锁等待、可中断的锁等待、公平性，以及实现非块结构的加锁。ReentrantLock在性能上似乎优于内置锁，其中在Java6中略有胜出，在Java5中则远远胜出。ReentrantLock的危险性比同步机制要高，如果忘记在finally块中调用unlock，那么虽然代码表面上能正常运行，但实际上已经埋下了一颗定时炸弹，并很有可能伤及其他代码。仅当内置锁不能满足需求时，才可以考虑使用ReentrantLock。

在一些内置锁无法满足需求的情况下，ReentrantLock可以作为一种高级工具。当需要一些高级功能时才应该使用ReentrantLock，这些功能包括：可定时的、可轮询的与可中断的锁获取操作，公平队列，以及非块结构的锁。否则，还是应该优先使用``synchronized``。

ReentrantLock实现了一种标准的互斥锁：每次最多只有一个线程能持有ReentrantLock。互斥是一种保守的加锁策略，虽然可以避免“写/写”冲突和“读/写”冲突，但同样也避免了“读/读”冲突。

读写锁：一个资源可以被多个读操作访问，或者被一个写操作访问，但两者不能同时进行。

ReentrantReadWriteLock为这两种锁都提供了可重入的加锁语义。与ReentrantLock类似，ReentrantReadWriteLock在构造时也可以选择是一个非公平的锁（默认）还是一个公平的锁。在公平的锁中，等待时间最长的线程将优先获取锁。如果这个锁由读线程持有，而另一个线程请求写入锁，那么其他读线程都不能获得读取锁，直到写线程使用完并且释放了写入锁。在非公平的锁中，线程获得访问许可的顺序是不确定的。写线程降级为读线程是可以的，但从读线程升级为写线程则是不可以的（这样做会导致死锁）。

读写锁允许多个读线程并发地访问被保护的对象，当访问以读取操作为主的数据结构时，它能提高程序的可伸缩性。
