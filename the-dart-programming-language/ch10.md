[A tour of the Dart language](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour)

Dart 2.3 introduced the **spread operator** (`...`) and the **null-aware spread operator** (`...?`), which provide a concise way to insert multiple elements into a collection.

Dart 2.3 also introduced **collection if** and **collection for**, which you can use to build collections using conditionals (`if`) and repetition (`for`).

Although the Set *type* has always been a core part of Dart, set *literals* were introduced in Dart 2.2.

To create an empty set, use `{}` preceded by a type argument, or assign `{}` to a variable of type `Set`:

```dart
var names = <String>{};
// Set<String> names = {}; // This works, too.
// var names = {}; // Creates a map, not a set.
```

 As of Dart 2, the `new` keyword is optional.
